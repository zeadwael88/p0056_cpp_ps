# ps0009 - Reinvent the wheel

## Required
To implement your own logic using pointers, references and functions concepts to

- swap elements of one array with elements of another (arrays may be of different sizes, so you have to handle that)

- swap 2 elements of 2 arrays determining their indices

- swap 2 elements in of an array determining their indices

- remove one element from an array by its index decreasing size of array by one (if index is not determined as an argument pop the last element of the targeted array)

- add one element to a specific index in an array resizing it and shifting from-the-index elements (if index is not determined as an argument push the element as the new last element in the targeted array. *don't overwrite the actual last element, add a new one*)

- take in consideration all bugs & errors, try to fix as much as you can of them.
